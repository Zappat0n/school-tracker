## About the Project

This is a web application to track the evolution of school students in the curriculum.

The front end is built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Redux](https://redux.js.org/).

The back end is built with [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/), and has been deployed to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)

[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) is the database employed to store the data.

## Description
